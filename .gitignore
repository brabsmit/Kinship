# Generated Data
# family_data.json is generated but placed in kinship-app/src/family_data.json
# It seems the user wants the repo to be clean, but usually generated assets needed for frontend might be kept if it's not run often.
# However, usually we ignore generated assets.
# Given the prompt, I'll ignore it.
