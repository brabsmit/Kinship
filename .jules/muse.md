**Logic:**
- Mapped specific keywords (NY, CT, England) and Year ranges to historical maps/engravings.
- Fallback to generic "Antique Parchment" for unmatched locations.

    - Captain John Smith's Map of New England (1616) for early settlers.
    - Park Map of Connecticut (1766) for colonial CT.
    - Bird's Eye View of NYC (1873) for 19th-century New Yorkers.

**Logic:**
- Targeted high-volume "Dry" profiles identified in survey (New Haven, London, Early MA/CT Towns).
- **Assets Added:**
    - **New Haven (1638-1750):** *Map of New Haven in 1641* (Atwater 1881). Replaces generic CT map for 75+ profiles.
    - **London (Pre-1666):** *Visscher's Panorama (1616)*. Provides a stunning pre-fire view of the city for 20+ ancestors.
    - **Early Settlements (1620-1660):** *Pilgrims Going to Church* (Boughton). assigned to Watertown, Sudbury, Ipswich, Hartford, Windsor to evoke "Puritan Life" rather than just geography.
    - **New England (General 1620-1650):** *Southern New England in 1634* (William Wood). A more accurate period map than the 1616 Smith map for established colonies.
