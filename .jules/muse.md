**Logic:**
- Mapped specific keywords (NY, CT, England) and Year ranges to historical maps/engravings.
- Fallback to generic "Antique Parchment" for unmatched locations.
- **Assets Added:**
    - John Speed's Map of Britain (1610) for UK ancestors.
    - Captain John Smith's Map of New England (1616) for early settlers.
    - Park Map of Connecticut (1766) for colonial CT.
