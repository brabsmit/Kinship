## 2024-05-30 - East Anglia & Long Island Pack
**Source:** Wikimedia Commons (Public Domain)
**Logic:**
- **East Anglia (Norfolk/Essex/Suffolk):** Mapped to *A Mapp of ye County of Norfolk* (Speed/Hollar, 1670). This provides a specific regional identity for the large cluster of ancestors from Norwich, Dedham, and Hingham, England, distinguishing them from the generic "UK" map.
- **Long Island (Colonial):** Mapped to *Map of Long Island (1686)*. This captures the unique Dutch/English colonial interface for the Oyster Bay and Hempstead clusters (1650-1750), which previously fell back to generic New England maps.
- **Norwich, CT:** Explicitly routed to *Puritan Life* (Boughton) for early settlement (<1700) and *Plan of the Colony of Connecticut* (1766) for the 18th century.

**Assets Added:**
- `norfolk_map_1610`: A Mapp of ye County of Norfolk (John Speed/Wenceslaus Hollar)
- `long_island_1686`: Map of Long Island (1686)
