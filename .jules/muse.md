## 2024-05-30 - East Anglia & Long Island Pack
**Source:** Wikimedia Commons (Public Domain)
**Logic:**
- **East Anglia (Norfolk/Essex/Suffolk):** Mapped to *A Mapp of ye County of Norfolk* (Speed/Hollar, 1670). This provides a specific regional identity for the large cluster of ancestors from Norwich, Dedham, and Hingham, England, distinguishing them from the generic "UK" map.
- **Long Island (Colonial):** Mapped to *Map of Long Island (1686)*. This captures the unique Dutch/English colonial interface for the Oyster Bay and Hempstead clusters (1650-1750), which previously fell back to generic New England maps.
- **Norwich, CT:** Explicitly routed to *Puritan Life* (Boughton) for early settlement (<1700) and *Plan of the Colony of Connecticut* (1766) for the 18th century.

**Assets Added:**
- `norfolk_map_1610`: A Mapp of ye County of Norfolk (John Speed/Wenceslaus Hollar)
- `long_island_1686`: Map of Long Island (1686)

## 2024-05-31 - Colonial & Frontier Visual Pack
**Theme:** Filling the gaps in Colonial New England and the Westward Expansion.
**Objective:** Provide visual context for ancestors in NJ, RI, Northern New England, and the Midwest (OH, MI, IL).

**Sources:**
- All assets are sourced from Wikimedia Commons (Public Domain / Creative Commons).
- Maps are primarily from the Library of Congress collection via Wikimedia.

**New Assets:**
1.  **New Jersey (1777):** *The Province of New Jersey, divided into East and West (Faden).*
    -   *Logic:* Use for any NJ birth/death prior to 1850.
2.  **Rhode Island (1814):** *Carey's Map of Rhode Island.*
    -   *Logic:* Use for RI events.
3.  **New Hampshire (1796):** *Greenleaf Map of New Hampshire.*
    -   *Logic:* Use for NH and VT (Northern NE context).
4.  **Ohio (1804):** *Map of Ohio (Early Statehood).*
    -   *Logic:* Visual anchor for the "Westward Pioneers" thread in the Midwest.
5.  **Michigan (1831):** *Burr Map of Michigan.*
    -   *Logic:* For ancestors moving into the Michigan Territory.
6.  **Illinois (1818):** *Melish Map of Illinois.*
    -   *Logic:* For early Illinois settlers.

**Visual Philosophy:**
-   **Sepia Tone:** All maps are treated with `sepia(20%)` to maintain visual consistency with the existing "Antique Paper" theme.
-   **Fallback:** Profiles in specific towns (e.g., "Englewood, NJ") will now gracefully degrade to the State Map instead of the generic texture.
