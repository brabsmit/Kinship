## 2024-05-30 - East Anglia & Long Island Pack
**Source:** Wikimedia Commons (Public Domain)
**Logic:**
- **East Anglia (Norfolk/Essex/Suffolk):** Mapped to *A Mapp of ye County of Norfolk* (Speed/Hollar, 1670). This provides a specific regional identity for the large cluster of ancestors from Norwich, Dedham, and Hingham, England, distinguishing them from the generic "UK" map.
- **Long Island (Colonial):** Mapped to *Map of Long Island (1686)*. This captures the unique Dutch/English colonial interface for the Oyster Bay and Hempstead clusters (1650-1750), which previously fell back to generic New England maps.
- **Norwich, CT:** Explicitly routed to *Puritan Life* (Boughton) for early settlement (<1700) and *Plan of the Colony of Connecticut* (1766) for the 18th century.

**Assets Added:**
- `norfolk_map_1610`: A Mapp of ye County of Norfolk (John Speed/Wenceslaus Hollar)
- `long_island_1686`: Map of Long Island (1686)

**Logic:**
- **Virginia (17th Century):** Mapped to *Adventures of Captain John Smith in Virginia (1624)*. Essential for the Jamestown/Virginia settlers.
- **Pennsylvania (Colonial):** Mapped to *Thomas Holme's Map of Pennsylvania (1687)*. Perfect for Quaker ancestors and early PA settlers, showing original land grants.
- **Industrial Era (Mill Towns):** Mapped to *Bird's Eye View of Lowell, MA (1876)*. Applied to profiles born 1820-1920 in key industrial cities (Lowell, Lawrence, Pittsburgh, etc.) to replace generic antique backgrounds with period-appropriate industrialization imagery.

**Assets Added:**
- `va_smith_1612`: Adventures of Captain John Smith in Virginia (1624)
- `pa_holme_1687`: Thomas Holme's Map of Pennsylvania (1687)
