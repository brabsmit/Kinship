# Welcome to Your Digital Family History

This interactive website brings your genealogy research to life. It transforms the comprehensive data from your manuscripts (`GENEALOGY DSD Paternal Ancestry.docx` and `GENEALOGY DSD Maternal Ancestry.docx`) into a navigable, visual experience.

While you are intimately familiar with the names and dates, this tool offers new ways to visualize connections, geography, and historical context using modern technology and AI.

## Getting Started

When you open the application, you are presented with the **Graph View**. This is your central dashboard.

### The Interface at a Glance
*   **The Sidebar (Left)**: Your command center. It contains the Search bar, Filter menu, and the list of family members.
*   **The Main View (Center)**: Displays the interactive family tree, map, or hitlist depending on your selection.
*   **The Profile Panel (Right)**: When you select an ancestor, their full story opens here.

## Exploring the Data

### 1. The Family Tree (Graph View)
The graph visualizes the connections between generations.
*   **Nodes**: Each box represents a person.
    *   **Colors**: <span style="color: blue">Blue</span> indicates the Paternal line, <span style="color: purple">Purple/Rose</span> indicates the Maternal line.
    *   **Badges**: Small icons appear on nodes to indicate special status (e.g., a "Quill" icon means there is a biography available).
*   **Navigation**: You can click and drag the canvas to move around. Scroll your mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
*   **Selection**: Clicking a person highlights their direct lineage and dims unrelated branches, making it easier to trace specific lines.

### 2. The Directory (List View)
If you prefer a structured text view, switch to **List View** using the toggle in the Sidebar header.
*   **Generations**: Relatives are grouped by their generation (e.g., "Generation 1", "Generation 2").
*   **Search**: Use the search bar to instantly filter names.
*   **Details**: Each entry shows the relationship ID (e.g., `1.1.2`), lifespan, and key tags (like "Immigrant" or "War Veteran").

### 3. Maps & Geography
Select the **"Map"** icon to see the geographical footprint of the family.
*   **Pins**:
    *   **Blue**: Birth locations.
    *   **Red**: Death locations.
    *   **Sepia**: Historical locations (places that may have changed names).
*   **Lines**: A line connecting birth and death points visualizes the migration path of an individual.

## The Immersive Profile
Clicking any name opens the **Immersive Profile**. This is designed to read like a magazine article or a history book chapter.
*   **Narrative**: The text is drawn directly from your notes in the Word documents.
*   **Life & Times Timeline**: This merges personal events (Birth, Marriage) with broader historical events (e.g., "Civil War Begins"), giving context to their lives.
*   **Trivia**: The system calculates interesting facts, such as "Lived during the reign of 3 Monarchs" or "Age at death: 74".

## Advanced Features

### Narrative Threads ("Epics")
The application automatically detects themes running through the family history. Click the **"Threads"** button in the sidebar to explore topics like:
*   **The Pilgrims**: Ancestors involved in the early settlement of New England.
*   **War Veterans**: A collection of all family members who served.
*   **The Industrialists**: Those involved in manufacturing and industry.

Selecting a thread filters the entire application to focus only on those individuals.

### The Research "Hitlist"
Accessible via the navigation menu, the **Hitlist** is a tool for managing missing data.
*   **Conflict Score**: The system analyzes missing dates, locations, or logical errors (e.g., dying before birth) and assigns a score to prioritize research.
*   Use this to quickly identify which ancestors need more attention in the source documents.

### AI Research Assistant
You will notice a **"Research This"** button on profiles. This uses Artificial Intelligence to analyze the biography and suggest new avenues for research.
*   **Context Aware**: It reads the specific profile and identifies potential record collections (e.g., "Check the 1850 Census for New Haven").
*   **External Links**: Where possible, it provides direct links to databases like FamilySearch or Archives.gov.
*   *Note: This feature requires an access code (`admin` / `password`).*

## Updating the Data
It is important to remember that this website is a **viewer**.
*   **Source of Truth**: Your Word documents remain the master records.
*   **Making Changes**: To correct a date or add a story, edit the Word document as you always have. When the application is updated, it will re-read your documents and reflect the changes automatically.
