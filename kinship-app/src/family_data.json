William Pitt was born in 1763, before Samuel.  However, the LVR shows Samuel as the child of Phillips and Sarah.  Furthermore, the Richardson family genealogy shows Samuel as the son of Sarah (although this could have been be pulled from the LVR);  I have wondered whether the marriage of Phillips and Mary and the birth of William Pitt (and later John and Mary) involved Phillips, Sr., who might have taken a younger wife when his wife (also Mary) died, but there is no evidence of this (and in fact no documentation of the death of Phillips, Sr. or his wife).  At any rate, Phillips, Jr. came to Leominster in 1743, then to Winchendon; served as a Sergeant in the 4/19/1775 Cambridge alarm and then as a Private in 1776 \u2013 1778; his son Phillips III (1760) moved to Marlborough, NH around 1799 (and ran the Sweetser Tavern there, photo in file) and Phillips, Jr. (1731) appears to have moved with him",
