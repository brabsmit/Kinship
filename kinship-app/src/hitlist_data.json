Consult vital records from Charlestown, MA, and England during the relevant periods (early 17th century) to confirm the correct dates. Look for church records (baptisms, burials), probate records, and land records. Start with sources local to Charlestown, MA to confirm if the death data is correct, and then broaden the search.",
      "**Research John Knight in Charlestown, Massachusetts records from the 1630s onwards.** Given the \"Immigrant\" tag and a death location in Charlestown, MA, focus on immigration records, passenger lists, and early Charlestown town records (land ownership, militia participation, etc.). This may help establish his presence in the colonies and potentially uncover his origins in England, thus clarifying the birth date and location.",

Check for other individuals mentioned in the surrounding paragraphs within the original source to see if that person's identity or date can confirm which John Knight this profile represents."
