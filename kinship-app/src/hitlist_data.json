Focus on timeframe +- 10 years of both dates.",
      "Investigate English parish registers and probate records from the 1600-1650 period, concentrating on regions from which other early Massachusetts settlers originated. Given the stated 'c. 1631 England' birth date, explore relevant records from that period. Start with online databases like Ancestry.com, Findmypast, and FamilySearch, and if necessary, consult with a professional genealogist specializing in English records.",
