      "1. **Verify Birth and Death Dates:** Given the impossible birth/death date combination (died before born), prioritize verifying the accuracy of both dates. Begin by consulting the 'Unknown' source reference cited in the metadata (Paragraph #2909) to determine the original record and its reliability. Expand research to include primary sources like church records (baptism, marriage, burial), probate records, and land deeds in Charlestown, MA, and England to corroborate or correct these dates.",
      "2. **Investigate Charlestown, MA Records:** Focus on records specific to Charlestown, MA, around the death date (1614, if accurate, or a more plausible timeframe). Examine early colonial records, town meeting minutes, and published genealogies focusing on early settlers of Charlestown. These records might reveal information about John Knight's presence in the area and potentially link him to other families or events. This could shed light on his origins, resolve the death date issue, or even provide clues to his birth location.",
      "3. **Explore English Genealogy Databases:** Given the 'England' indication in the birth date field, systematically search major English genealogy databases (e.g., Ancestry.co.uk, FindMyPast, FamilySearch) for John Knights born circa 1631. Use variations of the name and broaden the search to nearby years (1620-1640). Focus on records from areas that had strong ties to early Massachusetts settlements, such as East Anglia and the West Country. If a potential John Knight is found, carefully evaluate the evidence to determine if they are the same individual by checking for matching family members, occupation, or other connections to Charlestown, MA."

Search online databases such as Ancestry.com, FamilySearch, and genealogical society websites for published genealogies focusing on families with connections to Saybrook and Branford. Also, examine local historical societies' holdings in these areas."
